Act as an employee in a CA office and create a web app using all in one file (html + js + css). We need a work allotment tracker for 5 employees. It should also track whether the invoice sent to the client and payment received for the task. Payment may be after work completion or in advance depending on the choice. Add a logging in feature and it should be separate for partners and employees. Employees to be denoted as staff. Give separately a master data section where we can add staff name, client name, work details and these all to be added from the drop down option while adding tasks. It should give a monthly report of every employee giving details of work done by them and revenue received from their work and it should be exported to excel option. The Color of web app should be professional and light colour.Can you create for me.
